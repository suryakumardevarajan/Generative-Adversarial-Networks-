# Generative Adversarial Networks - Reproducibility

#### COMP 551 [project 4](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp551/files/miniproject4_spec.pdf)

In this project we replicate the GAN paper and perform experiments on its variants

Google Colab
We used Google Colab to run the files. 

# Project structure
The project is structured as follows -
1. **src** contains the source code of the project, consisting of the following files
2. **images** contains the best generated results from each of out datasets

# Running
1. Execute models and analyses:
'jupyter notebook .' in Google Colab
The files in the data folder need to be uploaded first to the root folder of Colab before running the notebook. Our implementation doesnâ€™t require any additional packages. All packages used by us come out of the box with Google Colab.
